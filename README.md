# Basic_MVC_CRUD_Template
This is a template that was created to review the basics of building a Full-Stack CRUD app. It's based on a tutorial by <a href="https://github.com/Mayanwolfe/Basic_MVC_CRUD_Template" target="_blank">Mayanwolfe</a>. 

## What is a full-stack web application?
A full-stack web application has a front-end, what the user sees and a back-end, the part that processes the CRUD requests. 

## What does CRUD mean?
